                Lustria is a large, tropical continent located within the southern hemisphere of the New World and is considered to be the rightful domain of the <i><b>Lizardmen</b></i> race. For long ages of the world, the mysterious continent of Lustria has remained hidden to outsiders. This is not by accident or by some geographical oddity, but rather by strongly maintained magical wards, enchantments which disorient intruders. Those that manage to pass through the unseen barriers find other dangers — Lustria’s coasts are home to treacherous tides, unnatural eddies and typhoons of great power. In its clear blue waters lurk scaled reptilian beasts whose jaws can splinter a ship’s hull. While the waters surrounding Lustria are perilous, the whole of the enormous continent is one of the most hostile regions in the entire world. 
                The majority of its landmass is covered in jungle, a dark abode where death comes in myriad guises. Mighty, prehistoric carnivores rule the forests — some actively stalking their prey, while others lurk in ambush, awaiting whatever wanders close. No less deadly are the jungle’s smaller killers; everywhere, debilitating parasites lurk, awaiting their opportunity to latch onto a new host, and the humid air buzzes with swarms of blood-sucking insects so voracious they can exsanguinate a man before his body can collapse to the forest floor. Only the Lizardmen and other cold-blooded creatures can endure the stifling heat and humidity for long; other races eventually sicken and die. To its native Lizardmen, however, Lustria is a haven — a deathtrap to invaders and a bulwark against the disorder set loose in the world with the coming of Chaos. Lustria contains mighty rivers, vast tracts of unbroken swampland, arid deserts, soaring mountains and a vast and fertile plain – deep grasslands and savannahs that stretch beyond the horizon. Yet one feature dominates all others.

                The Lizardmen, sometimes known as the Cold Ones or the Children of the Gods, are an ancient, savage, intelligent race of cold-blooded, reptilian humanoids that were at one time the first and oldest civilisation of the Warhammer World. Long before the rise of Men, Elf or Dwarf, the empire of the Lizardmen ruled supreme.
                Once, in a long and forgotten age, the Lizardmen ruled over it all, dominating this ancient world during an age of primeval monsters. Although their realm is now partly in ruins and overgrown, they seek once more to rise up and reclaim that which they have lost many millennia ago. While the task at hand remains near impossible, the empire of the Lizardmen still fights on - unleashing their cold-blooded savagery upon any who would stand in the way of their sacred mission.
                From the lush jungles they come, beneath totems of gold, the Lizardmen march to war, the ground trembling from the approach of their large and mighty reptilian armies. They go to battle for reasons indecipherable to others, an ancient plan known only to themselves.
                None can ever understand their motives nor their ceaseless drive, for none truly understand that they are the rightful inheritors of the world. It is their sacred, if inscrutable, duty to restore order across the planet. If this means the wholesale eradication of the lesser upstart races outside of the Great Plan, then the Lizardmen empire shall enact this world-spanning genocide once more.

                    <i><b>"On the fifth day of our expedition we lost yet another member of our party, but this time through the depredations of the native fauna rather than through disease or malnutrition. Making our way northwest along a shallow, fast-flowing stream, the lead man stopped dead in his tracks, indicating with a petrified expression the water breaking around his feet. All stopped and looked down to the water, where we spied a glossy black tentacle working its way slowly up his leg. Not a man knew what to do, but soon it was too late to do a thing for the poor wretch was yanked most violently beneath the surface where a great commotion went up. In a short moment, the thrashing ceased and silence descended. Then, a great jet of gore shot up, showering all with blood and gristle. Upon wiping the filth from my eyes I discovered myself alone, my companions having demonstrated the good sense to flee for their lives. Seeing the wisdom of their actions, I joined them forthwith..."</b></i>
