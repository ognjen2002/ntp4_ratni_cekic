                Naggaroth, the <b><i>"Land of Chill"</i></b>, is the bleak and forbidding northern continent of the New World that is as unforgiving as the Dark Elves who have claimed it as their home. Its northern plains are barren and windswept expanses, broken only by jutting outcrops of rock and magic-stained rivers, their waters sluggish and black, crisscross the ice fields, carving elaborate canyons and deep ravines in the frozen ground. Further south, the thin soil is more fertile, allowing sparse pine forests to grow. Here, the Dark Elves maintain huge plantations to feed the cities worked by slaves of many different races who labour until they drop dead, their bodies left to nourish the barren soil. The Dark Elves live in <b><i>six heavily fortified cities</i></b>, their innumerable towers built from black stone, rising like sinister pinnacles into the dark storm clouds. All of these cities are evil places, steeped in death and agony. Their lightless dungeons are crammed with captives whose wailings fill the air and whose moans seep through the thick walls of the high towers, saturating the soul with pain and misery. From the tips of the high towers, above the filth and smog of sacrificial fires, the Sorceresses cast their malign magic over the world.

            <h2><b>Major cities</b></h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Naggarond, the <b><i>Tower of Cold</i></b> or the City of Cold, is the oldest and largest of the Dark Elves' cities, and quite likely the <b><i>most malevolent place</i></b> in the world. Its outer walls form an imposing circlet of black stone, in no place less than a hundred feet tall. About the ramparts are set a hundred towers, each rising as high above the battlements as the walls rise above the bare rock.</li>
                <li>Ghrond, the <b><i>Tower of Prophecy</i></b>, is the domain of <b><i>Malekiths</i></b> mother, the beautiful seeress <b><i>Morathi</i></b>. From Ghrond’s pinnacle, <b><i>Sorceresses of the Dark Convent</i></b> can see through the snowstorms that whip about the ever-shifting Realm of Chaos. It is said that the patterns of change therein hold the secrets of fate and that all the mysteries of the world are laid bare to she who dares look.</li>
                <li>Karond Kar, the <b><i>Tower of Despair</i></b>, also known as <b><i>"Slavers Gate"</i></b>, can be counted the bleakest of all refuges. The citadel stands sentinel on the edge of the <b><i>Sea of Chill</i></b>, perpetually battered by gale-force winds, icy rain and tidal waves the size of mountains.</li>
                <li>Har Ganeth, the <b><i>City of Executioners</i></b> or the <b><i>City of Khaine</i></b>, is a cursed place dedicated to the worship of Khaine, the Bloody-Handed God.</li>
                <li>Hag Graef, the <b><i>Black Crag</i></b>, is a sinister and foreboding place, built at the bottom of a cold, dark canyon and completely surrounded by mountains of bare rock that stretch into the clouds. It is a city permanently in shadow, for no sunlight ever reaches its walls.</li>
                <li>Clar Karond, the <b><i>Tower of Doom</i></b>, serves as the Witch King's chief shipyard, for it is here that the keels are laid for many thousands of raiding vessels. This is a more sprawling city than others in Naggaroth, stretching from the banks of the <b><i>Redvenom River</i></b> up into the trackless pine forests of the <b><i>Duskridge</i></b>.</li>
            </ol>

Killers, despoilers, slavers and thieves we name them, but not one of these oft-earned titles begins to describe the depths of their depravity. They have neither mercy nor honour. They roam and kill in darkness called up by their foul sorceries. They are so base as to specifically target children for their depredations. The capricious folk of Ulthuan claim that they are their despised kin, exiled long ago, but truly, can one ever trust the words of an Elf?"</b></i>

                The Dark Elves, or the <b><i>Druchii</i></b> as they call themselves in their own tongue, also known as the <b><i>Naggarothi</i></b> or the <b><i>"Dark Ones"</i></b>, are one of the most ancient, powerful, and certainly the most sadistic of the three Elven civilisations of the world. In the bleak, chilly lands of the continent of Naggaroth in the New World lies the Dark Elven kingdoms of the <b><i>Witch King Malekith</i></b>, a realm born from the depths of malice and hate, a kingdom that seeks nothing more than to despoil a world its people believe loathes their existence. With malevolent eyes, the Dark Elves watch this dying world, knowing it is their birthright to rule all that they survey and those that live upon it are born to do nothing more than to grovel at their feet. The Druchii are raiders, enslavers and heartless reavers of the first degree, their every whim being nothing more than to sow misery and pain to all that oppose them, for misery and pain is the very lifeblood of their existence. Thus do their <b><i>Black Arks</i></b> and <b><i>Corsair Fleets</i></b> ply the great waters of the world, raiding and enslaving all before them as a tribute to their own avaricious desires.  Yet even should every other land bow to their rule, the Dark Elves know that they cannot claim their glorious inheritance whilst their hated brethren, the High Elves, endure. Until that day finally dawns when the Isles of Ulthuan are finally theirs, the Dark Elves will continue their bloody quest as they always have. Great raiding fleets, their sails black against the night sky, bring woe and destruction to all the shores of the world, bearing terror and death to distant realms, often for no better reason than because there is no one who can stand against them With every year that passes, the power of Naggaroth ascends to greater heights, built upon the backs of slaves and fuelled by a constant stream of plunder from far-off lands. As the other elder races fade, the Dark Elves thrive, knowing that their hour has at last come. Stormclouds gather across the High Elf realms, and the Witch King’s malevolent laughter echoes upon the wind. Naggaroth will rise, Ulthuan will fall, and a vengeance thousands of years in the making will finally see its bloody conclusion.

We strike where and when we will, leaving no doubt who are the true masters of the seas. We make slaves of the lesser races because they are fit for nothing else. It is only just that they should strive for their betters. What is truly insulting is how seldom any of them realises the honour we do them by enslaving them. Those we take are privileged to join something far greater than they ever would’ve been able to if we left them to lead their pathetic little lives. To serve the Witch King Malekith is to serve the greatest ruler the world has ever known. It is a shame that the wretches cannot see that, but what can you expect of such animals?"</b></i>

                Dark Elves are bitter, vicious killers that detest all other creatures — even other Dark Elves. Druchii warriors love nothing more than to see their enemies screaming in pain, and take pleasure from spilling blood and spreading misery. There are no Druchii craftsmen, workers or farmers — such menial roles belong to slaves; each and every Druchii is born, bred and trained to be a heartless warrior. They are relentlessly aggressive in battle, shouting praises to their black gods as they cut down their foes. The Dark Elves reserve their deepest enmity for the High Elves of Ulthuan, who they see as treacherous usurpers. For over five thousand years, the armies of Naggaroth have waged war upon their kin. Battles between Dark Elves and High Elves are exceptionally bloody, as the Dark Elves hurl themselves at their foes with unending ferocity and the warriors of Ulthuan stoically stand their ground despite the terrifying beasts and merciless agonies unleashed upon them. Thus do the dread hosts of Naggaroth spread across the world, their fell banners dancing grimly on the wind, each warrior alert to the prospect of wicked joy that every battle brings. Ranks of <b><i>spearmen</i></b> advance remorselessly across the field, a shadow of death that consumes all who stand in its path. <b><i>Black Ark Corsairs</i></b>, given monstrous aspect by their scaled cloaks, hack through the foe, each chill-hearted pirate determined that his bladework and cunning will outdo that of his fellows. <b><i>War Hydras</i></b> thunder into the fray, trampling those who stand their ground, belching forth dark flame to consume those who flee. <b><i>Cold One Knights</i></b> strike home in a blur of steel and claw, the cold skill of the riders matched only by the savagery of their steeds. <b><i>Sorceresses</i></b> unleash their dark and forbidden magic, stripping flesh from bone and soul from body. Blood-drenched <b><i>Witch Elves</i></b> dance amongst the carnage, slashing with frenzied abandon at any who come within reach. Directing every assault are the black-hearted <b><i>Dreadlords</i></b> of Naggaroth, who expend the lives of their followers as easily, and with as little compunction, as they order the destruction of the foe.

Though will it come to pass that the firstborn son of noble blood shall rise to power. The child will be learned in the darkest arts and he will raise an army of terrible beasts. Thus will the Dark King fall, slain by neither blade nor arrow but by a sorcerous power of darkest magic and so shall his body be consumed in the flames and for all eternity burn."</b></i>
