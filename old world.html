            <p> The <b><i>Old World</i></b> is part of the great eastern continent of the Warhammer World. It is the region of that landmass where most of the realms of Men are based and is usually defined as the area west of the Worlds Edge Mountains, north of the Blood River and the Dwarfs sea fortress of Barak Varr and south of the Troll Country. The isle of Albion lies off the coast of the Old World and is similar to the dread land of Norsca, in that it is neither a part of the Old World or entirely separate from it.
                The Old World is home to the Human realms of the <b><i>Empire</i></b>, <b><i>Kislev</i></b>, <b><i>Bretonnia</i></b>, <b><i>Tilea</i></b>, <b><i>Estalia</i></b> the independent city-state of <b><i>Marienburg</i></b> in the Wasteland, the Elven forest of <b><i>Athle Loren</i></b>, and the lawless <b><i>Border Princess</i></b>, as well as several <b><i>Dwarf holds and clans</i></b>.
                In the past, before the rise of Men, the Old World was ruled by Dwarfs and Elves, until the <b><i>"War of the Beard"</i></b> forever sundered the friendship that once defined relations between a Dwarf and Elf. The ruins of ancient structures built by those elder races are still scattered across the coastlines and high mountains of the Old World.

            <p>
                The different states of the Old World are rarely allied, and although relations between the various realms generally tend to be cordial, they have been known to go to war against each other. While there are interstate rivalries over such things as trade and natural resources, which have often proved a great source of wealth for some Old Worlders, the near-constant threats to life that exist in this region make working together an occasional necessity.
                The Old World has been invaded many times over the years: <b><i>Greenskins</i></b> hordes from the Badlands to the south, <b><i>Chaos</i></b> incursions from the north, <b><i>Skaven</i></b> attacks from their underground lairs, unrelenting armies of the <b><i>Undead Vampire Counts</i></b> from the east, and large scale raids by <b><i>Dark Elves</i></b> fleets have all threatened to destroy one or all of the realms of Men. However, Human lives are relatively short, and over the generations the memories of these events fade into myth and legend, and they become nothing more than stories to scare children at bedtime.

            <h1>Kingdoms of the Old World</h1>
            <h2>Empire</h2>
            <img id="karl" src="Karl Franz.png" a="Karl Franz" style="float:left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; border: 1px solid black; padding: 5px;">
            <p>
                The Empire has stood for over 2500 years as the most powerful nation of men in the Old World and possessing black powder technology while more antiquated weapons are still more common and the norm. The Empire was founded by <b><i>Sigmar Heldenhammer</i></b> from a collection of warring tribes inhabiting the region that is now the Empire. Sigmar was of the Unberogen tribe who inhabited what is now Reikland and he is now the patron deity of the Empire.
                The Empire is led by an Emperor, though he is elected from and by the ranks of the <b><i>Elector Counts</i></b>, rulers of each individual state. Though it has gone through various periods of fragmentation, it was reunited two centuries ago into the strong power it now is by Emperor <b><i>Magnus the Pious</i></b>. The current Emperor is <b><i>Karl Franz</i></b>.
