                The <b><i>Southlands</i></b> is a large, tropical continent located far to the south of the Old World, beyond the mysterious realm of <b><i>Araby</i></b> and the <b><i>Land of the Dead</i></b>. Its northern land mass is a barren wasteland of deserts, studded with dusty and deserted tomb-cities, while further south, it is a land of unspoiled jungle and swamp, isolated from the realms of Man, Elf and Dwarf for uncounted centuries. Many brave or foolish explorers and treasure hunters — though the two are often indistinguishable — have attempted to penetrate the thick jungles that make up the majority of the southern region of this land, but almost all have never been seen or heard of again. Legends tell that the Southlands was once joined to the continent of <b><i>Lustria</i></b>, and this is borne out by the many identical species of flora and fauna indigenous to both.
            </p>
            <h2><b>Overview</b></h2>
            <p>
                In the remote age of the Old Ones, the continent of Lustria was physically joined to the continent of the Southlands. This is clear from the fact that the same kind of jungle vegetation and animals exist on both continents and also that on both sides of the World Pond there are Lizardmen. It is even possible that the hidden Lizardman city of Zlatlan which lies deep in the jungles of the South Lands had already been founded before the continents drifted apart. The Elves of Ulthuan believe that it may have occurred at the time of the birth of their own land, which rose up from the sea and split the continents apart. The Slann Mage-Priests believe that the creation of the World Pond, as they call the Great Ocean, was a fundamental pan of the great world plan of the Old Ones. Indeed the Old Ones brought about the sundering of continents in order to create conditions favourable for the rise of the new races of Elves, Dwarfs and Men. The continents may have been joined by a kind of land ridge which subsided beneath the waves. An alternative explanation might be that volcanic forces resulted in a narrow sea widening to become an ocean and in the midst of this ocean erupted the land mass of Ulthuan, pushing apart the continents and causing the rise of great mountain chains elsewhere on the globe. 
                The Old Ones may have been able to use power derived from the movement of the sun, the moons and the stars as well as forces within the world itself, to change the shape of the continents and the oceans. Ever since the Old Ones vanished, the Slann Mage-Priests have been trying to understand and even regain some of their mysterious knowledge. The Slann perhaps find it difficult to come to terms with the possibility that the Old Ones did not regard them as the pinnacle of creation, but a stage on the way to the evolution of the Elves, Dwarfs and Men. The collapse of the warp gates and the pollution of the world by Chaos has in a strange way given a cosmic purpose to the Slann. Whatever the Old Ones intended, they never accomplished. The catastrophe overtook them and they perished, leaving only enigmatic glyphs to hint at their intentions. The new races they had created, although evidently capable, lacked wisdom and were at risk from Chaos.

            <p>Thus it was that the Slann felt themselves to be entrusted with the ancient task of continuing the plans of the Old Ones. They seek to protect the world while the new races continue to evolve and mature. Ultimately, and perhaps according to the vision of the Old Ones, the new races will triumph over the forces of Chaos. For the Slann believe that these forces were the enemies of the Old Ones even before they appeared upon the world, part of a cosmic struggle beyond comprehension. The Old Ones were engaged in no less a task upon the world than the creation of offspring which over countless millennia — perhaps not such a long time in the time scale of the Old Ones — would evolve to the point where they would rise up, contain and overpower Chaos forever, returning equilibrium to the entire universe. The Slann envisage the world as a great pond MI of tadpoles which must be guarded until the tadpoles can emerge full grown to fulfill their destiny. 
                The new ones are understandably too ignorant and primitive to know that they shouldn’t disturb the tranquillity of the Mage-Priests or subvert their sacred task by pillaging the sacred plaques. Many of the new ones are already victims of Chaos, like the Dark Elves and the Chaos Dwarfs. Then there are the strange races, never intended by the Old Ones, which were spawned by Chaos or which just evolved in the changed circumstances after the collapse of the Warp Gate, such as the Skaven, the Undead, the Orcs and Goblins and others. It is thus the task of the Saurus and Skinks to protect the cities of the Slann. Meanwhile, the Slann sometimes succeed in their efforts to adjust the shape of the world using what they know of the arcane powers of the Old Ones. Though this may cause floods, earthquakes and Dwarf, Elf or Human cities to disappear beneath the waves from time to time, the Slann know that this is for the ultimate good of all creation. Indeed, many of their own cities are ruined by the same process. Could it be thanks to the Old Ones and the Slann that the warp gate is surrounded by polar ice creating a bather against Chaos? One of the great pre-occupations of the Slann is whether or not the World Pond is as the Old Ones intended it, or whether further shifts were planned.

For thousands upon thousands of years have we fought them, and many think we will soon be defeated. Yet we have our plans, and some day we will take back our ancestral holds—or else destroy both those homes and the foul Orcs who now pollute them."</b></i>
