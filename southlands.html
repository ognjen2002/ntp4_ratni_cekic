                The <b><i>Southlands</i></b> is a large, tropical continent located far to the south of the Old World, beyond the mysterious realm of <b><i>Araby</i></b> and the <b><i>Land of the Dead</i></b>. Its northern land mass is a barren wasteland of deserts, studded with dusty and deserted tomb-cities, while further south, it is a land of unspoiled jungle and swamp, isolated from the realms of Man, Elf and Dwarf for uncounted centuries. Many brave or foolish explorers and treasure hunters — though the two are often indistinguishable — have attempted to penetrate the thick jungles that make up the majority of the southern region of this land, but almost all have never been seen or heard of again. Legends tell that the Southlands was once joined to the continent of <b><i>Lustria</i></b>, and this is borne out by the many identical species of flora and fauna indigenous to both.
            </p>
            <h2><b>Overview</b></h2>
            <p>
                In the remote age of the <b><i>Old Ones</i></b>, the continent of <b><i>Lustria</i></b> was physically joined to the continent of the Southlands. This is clear from the fact that the same kind of jungle vegetation and animals exist on both continents and also that on both sides of the World Pond there are <b><i>Lizardmen</i></b>. It is even possible that the hidden lizardmen city of <b><i>Zlatan</i></b> which lies deep in the jungles of the South Lands had already been founded before the continents drifted apart. The Elves of Ulthuan believe that it may have occurred at the time of the birth of their own land, which rose up from the sea and split the continents apart. The <b><i>Slann Mage-Priests</i></b> believe that the creation of the World Pond, as they call the <b><i>Great Ocean</i></b>, was a fundamental pan of the great world plan of the Old Ones. Indeed the Old Ones brought about the sundering of continents in order to create conditions favourable for the rise of the new races of Elves, Dwarfs and Men. The continents may have been joined by a kind of land ridge which subsided beneath the waves. An alternative explanation might be that volcanic forces resulted in a narrow sea widening to become an ocean and in the midst of this ocean erupted the land mass of <b><i>Ulthuan</i></b>, pushing apart the continents and causing the rise of great mountain chains elsewhere on the globe. 
                The Old Ones may have been able to use power derived from the movement of the sun, the moons and the stars as well as forces within the world itself, to change the shape of the continents and the oceans. Ever since the Old Ones vanished, the Slann Mage-Priests have been trying to understand and even regain some of their mysterious knowledge. The Slann perhaps find it difficult to come to terms with the possibility that the Old Ones did not regard them as the pinnacle of creation, but a stage on the way to the evolution of the Elves, Dwarfs and Men. The collapse of the warp gates and the pollution of the world by Chaos has in a strange way given a cosmic purpose to the Slann. Whatever the Old Ones intended, they never accomplished. The catastrophe overtook them and they perished, leaving only enigmatic glyphs to hint at their intentions. The new races they had created, although evidently capable, lacked wisdom and were at risk from Chaos.
            </p>

            </figure>
            <p>
                Thus it was that the Slann felt themselves to be entrusted with the ancient task of continuing the plans of the Old Ones. They seek to protect the world while the new races continue to evolve and mature. Ultimately, and perhaps according to the vision of the Old Ones, the new races will triumph over the forces of Chaos. For the Slann believe that these forces were the enemies of the Old Ones even before they appeared upon the world, part of a cosmic struggle beyond comprehension. The Old Ones were engaged in no less a task upon the world than the creation of offspring which over countless millennia — perhaps not such a long time in the time scale of the Old Ones — would evolve to the point where they would rise up, contain and overpower <b><i>Chaos</i></b> forever, returning equilibrium to the entire universe. The Slann envisage the world as a great pond MI of tadpoles which must be guarded until the tadpoles can emerge full grown to fulfill their destiny. 
                The new ones are understandably too ignorant and primitive to know that they shouldn’t disturb the tranquillity of the Mage-Priests or subvert their sacred task by pillaging the sacred plaques. Many of the new ones are already victims of Chaos, like the <b><i>Dark Elves</i></b> and the <b><i>Chaos Dwarfs</i></b>. Then there are the strange races, never intended by the Old Ones, which were spawned by Chaos or which just evolved in the changed circumstances after the collapse of the <b><i>Warp Gate</i></b>, such as the <b><i>Skaven</i></b>, the <b><i>Undead</i></b>, the <b><i>Orcs</i></b> and <b><i>Goblins</i></b> and others. It is thus the task of the Saurus and Skinks to protect the cities of the Slann. Meanwhile, the Slann sometimes succeed in their efforts to adjust the shape of the world using what they know of the arcane powers of the Old Ones. Though this may cause floods, earthquakes and Dwarf, Elf or Human cities to disappear beneath the waves from time to time, the Slann know that this is for the ultimate good of all creation. Indeed, many of their own cities are ruined by the same process. Could it be thanks to the Old Ones and the Slann that the warp gate is surrounded by polar ice creating a bather against Chaos? One of the great pre-occupations of the Slann is whether or not the World Pond is as the Old Ones intended it, or whether further shifts were planned.

            <h2><b>Greenskins</b></h2>
            <figure>
                <blockquote>
                    <i><b>"From the deepest, darkest tunnels they came, burrowing and banging, shouting and smashing. We soon learnt not to try to negotiate, save with axes and cannon. For thousands upon thousands of years have we fought them, and many think we will soon be defeated. Yet we have our plans, and some day we will take back our ancestral holds—or else destroy both those homes and the foul Orcs who now pollute them."</b></i>

                The Greenskins are a highly primitive and warlike race of bestial humanoid barbarians and raiders that occupy much of the Eastern Hemisphere of the Warhammer World.
                The term "<b><i>Greenskins</i></b>" is a common collective description used by many civilised nations to refer to the forces of the Orcs and Goblins and other biologically related races.
                The broadest division is between the <b><i>Orcs</i></b>, who are strong, brutish, and savage warriors, and the <b><i>Goblins</i></b>, who are smaller and weaker, but cunning and conniving creatures.
                The Greenskins are considered by many to be the <b><i>scourge of all civilisation</i></b>. These tribal warriors are extremely violent, raiding ceaselessly, carrying war and barbarism to all corners of the known world.
                Time and again, hordes of Greenskins would arise without warning and lay a great swath of destruction that has no direction or purpose other than simple violence.
                Indeed, the Greenskin race's single motive is violence, an ever increasing mass of warfare that has the potential to dominate and cover the entire world in a seething green tide.
                However, the Greenskins' tendency for warfare has created a division within their society that has ensured their race shall never reach such heights. Since the dawn of their history, the Greenskins have been plagued by a never-ending series of civil wars that has consumed millions of their own kind, for such is their desire for battle that Greenskin tribes have been known to fight each other just as much as they fight the other civilised races of the Old World.
                Though such strife should spell doom for their race, such are the Greenskins' ability to both survive and thrive in the harshest of environments that they can never truly be exterminated.

            <h2><b>Skaven</b></h2>
            <p>
                The Skaven, sometimes known as the <b><i>Ratmen</i></b>, the <b><i>Ratkin</i></b> or the <b><i>Children of the Horned Rat</i></b>, are a malevolent and diabolical race of large humanoid rat-creatures that inhabits a massive inter-continental underground empire known in their tongue simply as the <b><i>Under-Empire</i></b>, where at the very heart of Skavendom lies the horrific city of <b><i>Skavenblight</i></b>, the species capital city and the probable birthplace of the Skaven race. The Skaven as a whole are a cruel, treacherous and highly numerous species that have since spread their loathsome corruption to the farthest corners of the Warhammer World. From deep below the earth, these scavengers have built a vast Empire, whose military power and incomprehensible numbers has the potential to smother the kingdoms of the Old World in a seething tide of violence and anarchy. It is believed by all of Skaven-kind that the world is destined to be theirs, for they consider themselves the Supreme Master Race, undeniably superior in every way to all the other races of the World.

                This unwavering belief stems from the promises made by their horrifically malevolent deity, known by many legendary names, but his most well-known title is that of the <b><i>Horned Rat</i></b>. The Horned Rat is known as the <b><i>Harbinger of Corruption and Disease</i></b>, the embodiment of all things the Skaven are or ever will be, and whose worship over the Under-Empire is both supreme and absolute. Within the cruel hierarchy of the Under-Empire, the wishes and demands of the Horned Rat is issued and maintained by the ruthless tyranny of the <b><i>Council of Thirteen</i></b>, an organisation that consists of the <b><i>twelve most powerful Warlords</i></b> within the Under-Empire whilst the thirteenth seat is reserved for the Horned Rat himself. It is due only to the Council's harsh tyranny that the Under-Empire remains unified in some shape or form for centuries, for none could ever hope to overcome the legions of warriors the Council has under their iron-fisted rule.

And there they saw by the dying light of their torches the myriad eyes about them, glittering like liquid midnight as the rats closed in for the kill. The manlings stood back to back and fought for their lives, but against such implacable ferocity and countless numbers of the verminous horde, their weapons were useless. The tide of monstrous rats flowed over them one by one, dragging them down to be torn apart, the yellow chisel-teeth sinking into their soft-flesh, the dark furred mass drowning their pitiful screams with their hideous chittering..."</b></i>

                Out of all the mortal civilisations within the greater world, no single race, neither the ruthless barbarian tribes of the north nor the savage greenskins of the east can be compared in terms of instability to that of the Skaven Under-Empire. The Skaven race as a whole is <b><i>extremely divided</i></b>, often far more divided than perhaps any other race known in existence. Such disunion and ruthless lack of cooperation stems from the Skaven's insatiable need to survive, thrive, and reign tyrannically over his brethren. To a Skaven, there is no such thing as pity, remorse, compassion, or cooperation. There is simply survival, survival in a turbulent society that only spares those that possess the brute strength, extreme cunning, and the vicious instinct to outmanoeuvre and kill the opposition, no matter the cost or the body count of either friend or foe. Though no matter how divided their race may be, they are nonetheless unified in a single cause, and that cause is to conquer the surface world and bring about the <b><i>Great Ascendancy</i></b>, where it is said that the Horned Rat's children will swarm across the face of the earth and claim all of it as their own.

            <p>
                The Tomb Kings, known as the <b><i>Priest Kings</i></b> in their former lives, are the undying rulers of <b><i>Nehekhara</i></b>, an ancient Human civilisation that formed a great and powerful empire some two thousand five hundred years before the birth of Sigmar Heldenhammer and the founding of the Empire. Out of all the unliving creatures that would claim dominion and royalty over the dead, only the Tomb Kings could truly claim such masterful and undisputed sovereignty. For they had once ruled a mighty and far-flung empire during a time when the rest of Mankind were little more than savage barbarians.

            </figure>
            <p>
                Long ago, during an ancient and forgotten age, Nehekhara stood as a shining beacon of civilisation and Human achievement; a golden age when its cities shone with a majestic splendour, its buildings crafted from magnificent marble and limestone, its armies capable of conquering entire kingdoms. In this long-lost age, Nehekhara's mighty rulers reigned as living gods amongst men. But this great realm was destroyed millennia ago through acts of great treachery and powerful sorcery. The living of Nehekhara perished long ago in a single, mournful night, and in their absence, the dead stirred from their graves and claimed the land anew.
